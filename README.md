# optoro-data-help
A central location for our friends at Optoro to find our data sets

Each folder in this repo contains data sets of interest to Code for DC.

* **DC Main Streets:**  Management data for the Main Street Neighborhood Program. Requested during the Code for DC FOIA Party, receieved from Dept. of Small & Local Business Development

* **Mayor's Signed**: Mayor's Sign On Letters -- a list of letters and advocacy notes with other jurisdictions that the Mayor has hadded her signature to. Requested during the Code for DC FOIA Party.

* **Vacant Buildings**: Some (potentially not all) data related to vacant building inspections. Requested during the Code for DC FOIA Party from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The response letter (included here) contains links to several data sets that are pubicly accessible, but not on the Open Data DC portal. Some of those are already in the folder, but would encourage you to add more if you find them. 

* **Dept of Corrections:** DC's DOC functions a little differently than most. There is one jail, and no prison. The DC DOC posts weekly population stats on [their website](https://doc.dc.gov/page/correctional-facilities) in a PDF version of an excel sheet. there is minimal longitudnial tracking done, and [Open Data DC](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/incarceration-daily-counts-from-fy-2011-to-june-fy-2016) only has this info through FY2016. All data in this folder is pulled from the DOC's "data page"
